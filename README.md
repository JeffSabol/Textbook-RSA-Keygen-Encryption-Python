# Textbook-RSA-Keygen-Encryption-Python
A command line interface program to generate RSA keypairs and encrypt/decrypt messages, by applying Fermat's primality test, modular multiplicative inverse, and the RSA algorithm.

Run the file with "python3 RSA.py keygen -h" or "python3 RSA.py encrypt -h"
Use "python3 RSA.py encrypt -ARGS-HERE" for decryption also
